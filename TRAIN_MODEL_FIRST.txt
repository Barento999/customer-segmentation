========================================
⚠️ YOU NEED TO TRAIN THE MODEL FIRST!
========================================

The 500 error means the ML model hasn't been trained yet.

FOLLOW THESE STEPS:
-------------------

1. Open: http://localhost:5175

2. Click "Dashboard" in the top navigation bar

3. Click the "Train Model" button

4. Wait 5-10 seconds for training to complete

5. You should see:
   - "Model trained successfully"
   - Number of clusters
   - Silhouette score
   - Cluster visualizations

6. NOW go back to "Home" and try predicting again!

========================================
WHY THIS HAPPENS:
========================================

The ML model needs to be trained with data before
it can make predictions. This is a one-time setup.

After training once, the model is saved and you can
make predictions without training again (unless you
restart the backend server).

========================================
QUICK TEST AFTER TRAINING:
========================================

1. Go to "Home" page
2. Enter customer data:
   - Age: 35
   - Annual Income: 75.0
   - Spending Score: 85
   - Purchase Frequency: 20
3. Click "Predict Segment"
4. See the result! ✅
